# A-Star-Pathfinding-Visualization
This A* Path Finding Visualization will show you how  A* search algorithm works (using python & pygame). 
## [What is the A* Search Algorithm?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
A* Pathfinder is an informed search algorithm, or a best-first search, meaning that is is forumlated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific starting node of a graph, it aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.). It does this by maintaining a tree of paths originating at the start node and extending those paths one edge at a time until its termination criterion is satisfied.

## How to use (make sure you have pygame installed)
-> RUN astar.py
-> LEFT Click to define start point
-> LEFT Click to define end point
-> LEFT Click and drag to draw out obstacles
-> Space to watch the algorithm find the shortest path!
-> Hit "C" or "Middle mouse button" to clear the grid
